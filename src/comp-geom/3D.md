## Course Content
The main topics described in the course are:

- what is a data structure, semantic data model and reality;
- an introduction to topological properties such as 2-manifoldness and the genus;
- what are surface representations (b-rep) and volumetric representations;
- voxel models and voxelisation;
- constructive solid models (CSG) and Nef polyhedra;
- (constrained) tetrahedralisation;
- splines and NURBS;
- generalised (g-) and combinatorial maps (c-maps);
- sweeps and instantiation;
- the industry foundation classes (IFC);
- the iso 19107 geometry representations;
- the basics of how to reconstruct a 3D city model;
- CityGML and CityJSON; and
- applications of 3D models (eg calculation of volumes and solar potential).

For this assignment I implemented a method to simplify a 3D city model by merging neighbouring buildings into blocks. This method involved the following steps:

1. read the triangles in the input 3D city model from an OBJ file and load it into a data structure;
2. for each triangle, compute its (expanded) bounding box;
3. use the bounding boxes to find pairs of neighbouring triangles;
4. assign groups of neighbouring triangles to blocks;
5. in each block, store all the points of its triangles’ vertices;
6. for each block’s points, compute its convex hull and its min/max z values;
7. using each block’s convex hull and min/max, create triangles for its output roof, floor and wall geometries;
8. output the triangles to an OBJ file.

In its current form, the [3DBAG dataset](https://3dbag.nl/) contains for each of the 10M+ buildings in the Netherlands:

1. the 3D geometry at three [LoDs](https://3d.bk.tudelft.nl/lod/): 1.2+1.3+2.2
2. several attributes, eg the construction year, the height of the ground, the type of roof, current status of the building, etc.

For this assignment, we are asked to calculate a few useful attributes (those can be useful for others when processing the 3DBAG files) and to add them to the file. The attributes are namely:

- volume
- orientation
- area+orientation of the "RoofSurface" surfaces
- geometric difference between the LoD1.3 and LoD2.2 (with Hausdorff distance)

The updated model must be delivered in the [CityJSON](https://www.cityjson.org/) format.

The aim of this assignment is to implement a BIM to Geo conversion for one building. In short, this will involve five steps:

1. converting the BIM model to OBJ using IfcConvert;
2. loading each object in the OBJ file(s) into a CGAL Nef polyhedron;
3. processing the Nef polyhedra into a single big Nef polyhedron representing the space filled by the building’s floors, walls, windows and so on;
4. extracting the geometries representing the building’s exterior surface and individual rooms;
5. writing the geometries to a CityJSON file with correct semantics.

Everything was implemented in C++ with the help of packages from the [CGAL](https://www.cgal.org/) library and Niels Lohmann’s [JSON for Modern C++ library](https://github.com/nlohmann/json).
