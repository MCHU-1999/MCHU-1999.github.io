## GEO5015: Modelling Wind and Dispersion in Urban Environments

### Wind and Dispersion Simulation at Delft Campus: [Report](https://github.com/MCHU-1999/geo-5015-wind-modeling/blob/master/report.pdf) 
Understanding wind flow and pollutant dispersion in urban environments is critical for designing healthier cities. In this study, we use Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) to simulate the current wind and pollution conditions on the TU Delft campus. This area includes a complex mix of open spaces, buildings of different height, and pedestrian zones, all of them influence local airflow and dispersion behavior. In this study, we compare three simulation cases that vary in their level of detail (LoD) and inclusion of water and vegetation surfaces.

The primary objective is to analyze the existing wind conditions and dispersion patterns. Based on this goal, the study also explores strategies to address two key questions:
1. How can wind speed at pedestrian height be minimized to improve comfort and safety?
2. How can pollutant dispersion be enhanced to promote better air quality at pedestrian height?
