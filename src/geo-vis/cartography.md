## GEO1002: Geographical Information Systems (GIS) and Cartography
[This course](https://www.studiegids.tudelft.nl/a101_displayCourse.do?course_id=63949) provides an overview of Geographical Information Systems (GIS) and digital Cartography, and of how GIS can be used in practice to solve real-world problems. The course also provides students with theoretical background knowledge of concepts, data types and GIS-related typical processes and algorithms of GIS packages.

The course has both a theoretical and a practical part in which students do exercises to get hands-on experience with GIS packages. The open-source software QGIS and GRASS GIS/SAGA GIS packages and FME by Safe Software are used for this purpose. 


## Coursework Overview
### GRASS GIS for Comprehensive Spatial Analysis
This multi-part assignment utilized GRASS GIS to perform three fundamental types of geospatial analyses, demonstrating proficiency in various GIS analytical techniques.
1. Solar analyses
2. Network analyses
3. Data integration

#### Key Outcomes
- Created comprehensive solar potential maps for renewable energy planning
- Developed accessibility models using advanced network algorithms
- Established methodology for integrating multi-source spatial data
- Applied appropriate spatial statistics for data validation and uncertainty assessment

:::

This project applied advanced GIS techniques to analyze building energy performance across an urban environment, developing actionable insights for energy efficiency improvements. More specifically, they are:
1. Data preparation, integration and assessment,
2. Energy performance analysis of the building stock,
3. Presentation of results and scenarios.

#### Key Outcomes
- Identified priority areas for energy efficiency interventions
- Quantified potential energy savings through various improvement scenarios
- Developed replicable methodology for urban-scale energy performance assessment
- Created decision support tools for urban energy planning
