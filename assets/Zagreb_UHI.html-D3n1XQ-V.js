Our work required overcoming significant obstacles related to Croatia&#39;s underdeveloped National Spatial Data Infrastructure (NSDI). The available geospatial data suffered from inconsistencies, gaps, and quality issues, forcing us to develop several workarounds and custom solutions. Through extensive data cleaning, validation, and integration efforts, we not only addressed our primary research question but also generated several valuable byproducts. These included fraction of vegetation data, sky view factor, improved municipal boundaries, ...etc. Ultimately, our methodology provides actionable data for policymakers while contributing to climate change mitigation efforts.</p><h3 id="sky-view-factor" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#sky-view-factor"><span>Sky View Factor</span></a></h3><p>The Sky View Factor (SVF) was computed using the <a href="https://landscapearchaeology.org/qgis-terrain-shading/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Terrain Shading</a> plugin (Landscape Archaeology, 2024). This analysis was conducted on the normalized Digital Surface Model (nDSM) obtained from <a href="https://dgu.gov.hr/UserDocsImages/dokumenti/Pristup%20informacijama/Podnesi%20zahtjev/OSTALI%20ZAHTJEVI/ZAHTJEV%20-%20PODACI%20nDMP.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">dgu.gov.hr</a>. Due to time constraints, the original nDSM was rescaled to a lower resolution to optimize processing performance. The resulting SVF values, ranging from 0 to 1, are presented below, illustrating the distribution of sky visibility within the study area.</p><figure><img src="'+h+'" alt="sky_view_factor" tabindex="0" loading="lazy"><figcaption>Sky View Factor</figcaption></figure><h3 id="fraction-of-vegetation" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#fraction-of-vegetation"><span>Fraction of Vegetation</span></a></h3><p>The Vegetation Fraction was computed using the land cover dataset obtained from <a href="https://developers.google.com/earth-engine/datasets/catalog/ESA_WorldCover_v200" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">ESA WorldCover v200</a>.
