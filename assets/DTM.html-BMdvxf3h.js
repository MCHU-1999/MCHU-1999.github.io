They are the necessary input for several applications (eg flood modelling, visibility, effects of climate change on the north poles, etc.), and they are also relevant for studying for seabed and other planets.</p><p>The course provides an overview of the fundamentals of digital terrain modelling (DTM):</p><ul><li>different representations of terrains: TINs, rasters, point clouds, contour lines</li><li>reconstruction of terrains from different sources (LiDAR, photogrammetry, InSAR)</li><li>spatial interpolation methods</li><li>conversion between different DTM representations</li><li>processing of DTM: outlier detection, filtering, segmentation, and identification and classification of objects</li><li>applications, eg runoff modelling, watersheds computations, visibility</li><li>techniques to handle and process massive datasets</li><li>The course has both a theoretical part and a practical part where students reconstruct, manipulate, process, and extract information from terrains.</li></ul><p>All the labs are programming tasks (to be done with the Python or C++ programming languages), and other open-source libraries and software are used.</p><h3 id="a1" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#a1"><span>A1</span></a></h3><p><a href="https://3d.bk.tudelft.nl/courses/backup/geo1015/2024/hw/01/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Full task description</a></p><p>The aim of the assignment is to extract the isolines from a triangulated TIN, and structure them so that we can easily create Tanaka contours with QGIS.</p><p>The Tanaka contours method, named after the cartographer Kitiro Tanaka who formalised it in 1950, is a visualisation method to shade isolines to give a better impression of the relief of a terrain (more information on Wikipedia). The lines are illuminated/white when facing the source of light, and shaded/black when not.
