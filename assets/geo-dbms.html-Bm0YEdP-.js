The geo-DBMS is the central component of the geo-information chain. All information observed and interpreted should be managed in a manner that supports further use, so the Geo-DBMS is the end-point of data collected. Analysis, visualizing and (web-) dissemination of the geo-information start from the geo-DBMS. It is crucial that the content of the geo-DBMS is clear (the information model and its associated semantics) to the users, but also that it is high performant, as the geo-data volumes are often very high and especially in a web-based environment there may be many uses. The course consists of three parts; the first two concern introductions. The main part is devoted to spatial modelling and geo-DBMS. More specifically the three parts cover:</p><ol><li>Introduction object-oriented information modelling: UML and more specifically class diagram to create conceptual models.</li><li>Introduction relational database management systems: the relational model, SQL DDL (schema definition) and DML (queries).</li><li>Spatial databases: theoretical aspects of spatial modelling (object and field models), DBMS-GIS architectures (dual, layered, integrated), spatial-temporal data model, Abstract Data Types (ADTs) for geometric primitives, topology model, temporal aspects, spatial indexing (quad tree, r-tree, field-tree), spatial data clustering (Hilbert, Morton, Cantor, row, row prime, etc.), geo-DBMSs (data modelling, structures, queries, visualisation), (non-)commercial systems (Oracle Spatial, PostGIS, etc.). One or more advanced topics: 3D, Raster, Point cloud data, Simplicial complexes, Geo-OCL, Big data, NoSQL (spatial), Vario-scale, 5D modelling (deeply integrated 3D space, time and scale).</li></ol><h2 id="coursework-overview" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#coursework-overview"><span>Coursework Overview</span></a></h2><p>This course covered comprehensive aspects of spatial database management systems through 7 laboratory sessions, building from fundamental database concepts to advanced spatial data handling techniques.</p><h3 id="lab-1-data-modeling-with-uml" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#lab-1-data-modeling-with-uml"><span>Lab 1: Data Modeling with UML</span></a></h3><p>Created Entity-Relationship diagrams using UML notation to model spatial data relationships and object hierarchies.
